##  Dataset: LIDC - IDRI 
The LIDC-IDRI is a lung cancer screening dataset which comprises thoracic CT
scans for a total of 1010 patients, alongside with annotated nodules, made during a two-phase annotation
process by four experienced radiologists. The Dataset can be downloaded from this website https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/display/Public/LIDC-IDRI and contains standardized DICOM representation of the annotations and characterizations
collected by the LIDC/IDRI initiative, originally stored in XML

## Roadmap
- Preprocess LIDC dataset
- Feature extraction
- Feature selection
- Training and statistics

## Libraries
Libraries that need download - pandas, matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn, numpy, scikit-learn (sklearn), pylidc, radiomics, SimpleITK, scikit-image (skimage), scipy, pydicom
